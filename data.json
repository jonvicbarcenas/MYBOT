      "body": "Hey Oilegriv, Joseph John Thomson, also known as J.J. Thomson, proposed the plum pudding model of the atom in 1904. This model was based on his discovery of the electron in 1897, which showed that atoms were not indivisible as previously thought, but were instead composed of smaller subatomic particles.\n\nIn the plum pudding model, Thomson envisioned the atom as a uniform, positively charged sphere with electrons embedded throughout like \"plums in a pudding.\" The positive charge of the sphere was thought to balance out the negative charge of the electrons, resulting in a neutral atom.\n\nThomson's model was a significant step forward in our understanding of atomic structure, as it introduced the idea of subatomic particles and challenged the prevailing notion of the atom as an indivisible unit. However, it was later superseded by Rutherford's nuclear model of the atom, which showed that the positive charge and most of the atom's mass were concentrated in a tiny, dense nucleus at the center of the atom, with electrons orbiting around it.\n\nAs of January 10, 2024, Wednesday, 9:31AM, the total number of requests is: 30359",

      "body": "The Lotus Sutra holds great importance in Mahayana Buddhism for several reasons:\n\n1. Teachings of the Buddha: The Lotus Sutra is believed to contain the final and most profound teachings of Gautama Buddha. It is considered a summary of his entire lifetime of teachings, presenting a comprehensive view of the nature of reality, the path to enlightenment, and the ultimate goal of liberation.\n\n2. Universal Salvation: The Lotus Sutra emphasizes the concept of universal salvation, stating that all beings are capable of attaining Buddhahood. It teaches that every being possesses an innate Buddha nature and can ultimately reach enlightenment, regardless of their past actions or current circumstances. This message of inclusivity and compassion has led many followers to perceive Mahayana Buddhism as more accessible and egalitarian compared to other Buddhist traditions.\n\n3. Skillful Means: The Lotus Sutra is renowned for its emphasis on skillful means, which are expedient methods employed by Bodhisattvas to guide and support sentient beings on their path towards enlightenment. These skillful means may vary according to the needs and capacities of different individuals, promoting adaptability, compassion, and understanding in the pursuit of spiritual awakening.\n\n4. Emphasis on Faith and Devotion: The Lotus Sutra emphasizes the importance of faith and devotion in the path to enlightenment. It encourages practitioners to have unwavering faith in the Buddha's teachings and the boundless potential of all beings to attain Buddhahood. This emphasis on faith has greatly influenced the development of Pure Land Buddhism, a popular Mahayana school centered around devotion and reliance on the Buddha Amitabha.\n\n5. Symbolic and Allegorical Nature: The Lotus Sutra employs various symbolic and allegorical narratives to convey its teachings. These stories help elucidate complex concepts and make the teachings more relatable and understandable for practitioners. The elaborate parables and metaphors in the sutra, such as the parable of the burning house or the Lotus flower itself, provide profound insights into the nature of reality and the path to liberation.\n\nOverall, the Lotus Sutra is highly revered in Mahayana Buddhism due to its comprehensive and inclusive teachings, its emphasis on skillful means and faith, and its symbolic narratives that inspire practitioners on their spiritual journey.\n\nThe Bot Was Created on https://botfb.kenliejugarap.com\n\nDon't forget to follow to see the updated versions of this bot\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kenlienjugarap\n©PLAYSBOT\n\nhttps://click2donate.kenliejugarap.com\n(Clicking the link above and click any ads or button and wait for 30 seconds (3 times) everyday is a big donation and help to us to maintain the servers, last longer, and upgrade servers in the future)",

      "body": "⛈| 𝗙𝗨𝗝𝗜 𝗔𝗜 |⛈\n\nMagandang araw po, Edrian Neo! Ang price elasticity of supply ay tumutukoy sa pagbabago sa halaga ng produkto na inaalok ng mga supplier bilang tugon sa pagbabago sa presyo nito. Ito ay batay sa reaksiyon ng mga supplier sa pagbabago ng presyo ng produkto.\n\nMayroong tatlong pangunahing uri ng price elasticity of supply:\n\n1. Perfectly Elastic (Ganap na Elastiko): Ang supply ay tinatawag na perfectly elastic kapag ang mga supplier ay labis na responsive sa pagbabago ng presyo. Sa ganitong kaso, kahit na maliit na pagtaas o pagbaba sa presyo, agad itong sinasamantala ng mga supplier sa pamamagitan ng mabilis na pagtaas o pagbaba ng kanilang produksyon. Halimbawa ng produkto na may ganitong uri ng price elasticity of supply ay ang mga komoditi o produkto na may maraming magkumpitensyang supplier gaya ng bigas, gulay, at iba pa.\n\n2. Unitary Elastic (Pantay na Elastiko): Sa unitary elastic na supply, ang pagtaas o pagbaba sa presyo ng produkto ay sinusundan o sinusumbatan ng karampatang porsyento ng pagbabago sa produksyon ng mga supplier. Ibig sabihin, ang pagbabago sa presyo at produksyon ay pantay o magkapareho. Isang halimbawa ay ang mga bilihan ng mga mamahaling sasakyan, kung saan ang mga supplier ay maaaring mag-adjust ng produksyon upang sumunod sa pagbabago sa presyo ng mga sasakyan.\n\n3. Inelastic (Di-Elastiko): Sa inelastic na supply, ang mga supplier ay hindi gaanong responsibo sa pagbabago ng presyo. Ibig sabihin, maaaring mayroong malaking pagtaas o pagbaba sa presyo ngunit ang produksyon ay hindi gaanong nagbabago. Halimbawa ng mga produkto na may inelastic na price elasticity of supply ay ang mga gamot na nireseta ng mga doktor. Kahit na tumaas ang presyo ng gamot, hindi ito agad naaapektuhan ng produksyon dahil sa ibang mga salik tulad ng regulatoryong proseso at mga limitadong mapagkukunan.\n\nNawa'y nakatulong ako sa inyong tanong. Kung mayroon pa kayong ibang katanungan, huwag mag-atubiling itanong ulit. 😊👍\n\n𝗗𝗘𝗩𝗘𝗟𝗢𝗣𝗘𝗥 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗞: https://www.facebook.com/marjhuncutiee\n\n✿━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━✿\n🌸|• ᴄᴏᴍᴍᴀɴᴅ [ ᴀɪ ] ᴇxᴇᴄᴜᴛᴇᴅ ᴛɪᴍᴇ :\n2024-01-10 09:37:07 AM",

      "body": "One of the most famous teachings of Mahayana Buddhism that has attracted widespread attention is the concept of \"emptiness\" (shunyata). Emptiness is a profound philosophical principle that challenges our understanding of the nature of reality. According to Mahayana teachings, all phenomena, including ourselves, are ultimately empty of inherent or independent existence.\n\nMahayana Buddhism interprets emptiness as the idea that everything is interdependent and lacks fixed, independent identities. This teaching encourages practitioners to perceive the world and all phenomena as transient, interconnected, and imbued with a certain degree of relativity. By understanding emptiness, it is believed that one can transcend dualistic thinking and experience a more profound level of wisdom and compassion.\n\nThis concept has gained significant popularity because it offers a fresh perspective on our understanding of the self, others, and the world. It emphasizes the interdependence of all beings and emphasizes the importance of compassion and empathy. The concept of emptiness has influenced various fields of study, including philosophy, psychology, and even neuroscience, as it challenges conventional notions of self and reality.\n\nMoreover, the idea of emptiness has also influenced various artistic expressions, such as poetry, literature, and visual arts. It has provided a contemplative framework for artists and thinkers to explore the nature of existence and the impermanence of all things.\n\nOverall, the concept of emptiness in Mahayana Buddhism has become widely known and appreciated for its profound implications on how we understand and relate to the world around us. It offers a transformative perspective that encourages practitioners to cultivate compassion, wisdom, and a deeper sense of interconnectedness.\n\nThe Bot Was Created on https://botfb.kenliejugarap.com\n\nDon't forget to follow to see the updated versions of this bot\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kenlienjugarap\n©PLAYSBOT\n\nhttps://click2donate.kenliejugarap.com\n(Clicking the link above and click any ads or button and wait for 30 seconds (3 times) everyday is a big donation and help to us to maintain the servers, last longer, and upgrade servers in the future)",

      "body": "Hey Edrian, Price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of the quantity of a good or service supplied to changes in its price. It is calculated as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.\n\nThere are three main types of price elasticity of supply:\n\n1. Elastic supply: This means that the quantity supplied changes significantly in response to a change in price. For example, if the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied will increase significantly. This is often the case for goods that are relatively easy to produce and for which there are many substitutes.\n2. Inelastic supply: This means that the quantity supplied does not change much in response to a change in price. For example, if the price of a good increases, the quantity supplied will not change much. This is often the case for goods that are difficult to produce or for which there are few substitutes.\n3. Unit elastic supply: This means that the quantity supplied changes in the same proportion as the change in price. For example, if the price of a good increases by 10%, the quantity supplied will also increase by 10%.\n\nHere are some examples of products that fall into each category:\n\n Elastic supply: Fruits, vegetables, clothing, electronics\n Inelastic supply: Gasoline, prescription drugs, housing\n Unit elastic supply: Coffee, tea, gasoline\n\nThe price elasticity of supply is an important concept in economics because it can help businesses and policymakers understand how the market will respond to changes in price.\n\nAs of January 10, 2024, Wednesday, 9:37AM, the total number of requests is: 30396",

This perspective suggests that most financial problems can be avoided or mitigated through better budgeting, saving, and wise spending habits. It emphasizes the importance of education and personal responsibility in resolving financial issues.\n\nEvidence/Reason: Studies have shown that many people struggle with basic financial literacy, which can lead to poor financial decisions and long-term consequences.

      "body": "Ang kamatayan pinalthy, o mas kilala bilang death penalty, ay isang on-going na isyung kinakaharap ng maraming bansa sa buong mundo. Ito ay ang parusang ipinapataw sa mga krimen na itinuturing na malalala at hindi mapapatawad. Sa pamamagitan ng death penalty, ang isang tao ay idineklara ng batas na dapat ito'y mamatay bilang parusa sa kanyang mga nagawang kasalanan.\n\nMayroong mga taong sumasang-ayon at tumututol sa implementation ng death penalty. Ang mga sang-ayon ay naniniwala na ang death penalty ay isang epektibong paraan upang patawan ng parusa ang mga seryosong kriminal. Naniniwala sila na ito ay makatutulong sa pagpapanatili ng kaayusan at pagiging disiplinado ng lipunan. Sa pamamagitan ng pag-alis ng mga mapanganib at malalaking kriminal, inaasahang magkakaroon ng takot sa mga potensyal na gumawa ng mga kahalayang gawain.\n\nBukod sa mga bayan at estado na naniniwala na ang death penalty ay isang epektibong paraan upang mapanatili ang kaayusan, mayroon din silang paniniwalang ito ay isang balanseng paraan ng parusa. Naniniwala sila na ang pagbibigay ng ibang parusa lamang ay hindi sapat upang labanan at sugpuin ang mga malalalang krimen sa lipunan. Sa kanilang mga pananaw, ang death penalty ay isang patas na parusa sa mga taong nagkakasala ng mga karumal-dumal na krimen tulad ng rape, pagpatay, at iba pang paglabag sa mga karapatan ng tao. Ang pagkakaroon ng death penalty ay nagbibigay ng mensahe sa iba na ang paglabag sa batas na nagreresulta sa kalokohan at kawalan ng paggalang sa buhay ay may mas malalang parusa.\n\nSa kabila ng mga argumento ng mga sang-ayon sa death penalty, may mga taong matapang na tumututol sa pagpapataw nito. Ang mga tumututol ay naniniwala na ang death penalty ay isang paglabag sa karapatang pantao ng isang indibidwal. Naniniwala sila na ang bawat nilalang ay may karapatang mabuhay, kahit na ito'y may nagawang mabigat na kasalanan. Naniniwala sila na bilang tao, hindi tayo dapat pumatay ng ibang tao, kahit pa gaano man malalim ang kasalanan nila. Sa pamamagitan ng pagpapataw ng parusang kamatayan, nagdudulot ito ng kaguluhan at kawalan ng katarungan sa lipunan.\n\nBilang isang mamamayan, mahalagang maging mapanuri tayo sa mga isyung katulad nito. Ang pagkakaroon ng death penalty ay isang seryosong usapin na kailangan pag-aralan at bigyan ng sapat na pansin. Kailangan nating timbangin ang mga epekto nito sa lipunan at sa mga taong nabibigyan ng parusang kamatayan. Ang mga argumento at mga paniniwala ay nagdudulot ng pag-aaway at hindi pagkakaunawaan sa isyu.\n\nSa huli, ang mga pamamaraan ng pagpapanatili ng kaayusan at pagpaparusa sa mga nagkasala ay dapat na makatarungan, malasakit sa mundo, at naglalayong maging bahagi ng malaking solusyon at hindi dahilan para sa mas malalim na problema. Kailangan nating pakinggan ang iba't ibang panig at maging bukas sa pagsusuri ng mga argumento upang makabuo ng isang lipunang nagmamalasakit sa bawat isa.\n\nThe Bot Was Created on https://botfb.kenliejugarap.com\n\nDon't forget to follow to see the updated versions of this bot\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kenlienjugarap\n©PLAYSBOT\n\nhttps://click2donate.kenliejugarap.com\n(Clicking the link above and click any ads or button and wait for 30 seconds (3 times) everyday is a big donation and help to us to maintain the servers, last longer, and upgrade servers in the future)",

Ang perspektibang ito ay nagmumungkahi na ang karamihan ng mga problema sa pinansyal ay maaaring iwasan o maibsan sa pamamagitan ng mas mahusay na pagbabadyet, pag-iimpok, at matalinong paggastos. Ito ay nagbibigay-diin sa kahalagahan ng edukasyon at personal na responsibilidad sa paglutas ng mga suliraning pinansyal.\nKatibayan/Dahilan: May mga pag-aaral na nagpapakita na maraming tao ang may problema sa basic na kaalaman sa pinansya, na maaaring magdulot ng maling mga desisyon sa pinansya at mga pangmatagalang konsekwensya. Sa pamamagitan ng pagpapabuti ng edukasyon sa pinansya at pagsulong ng mabuting mga pag-uugali sa pinansya, mas mabuti nilang maayos ang kanilang mga pinansya at maibaba ang posibilidad ng mga problema sa pinansyal.\n\nTindog 2: Ang mga problema sa pinansyal ay primarilyong hindi pantao at resulta ng mga hindi patas na ekonomiya at mga sistema na humahadlang sa kakayahan ng mga indibidwal na magtagumpay at magkaroon ng seguridad sa pinansya. Ang perspektibang ito ay nagbibigyang diin sa papel ng mga salik tulad ng kawalan o kakulangan ng sapat na sahod, pagtaas ng halaga ng pamumuhay, at limitadong access sa abot-kayang tirahan o pangangalaga sa kalusugan sa paglikha at pagpapatuloy ng mga problema sa pinansyal.\nKatibayan/Dahilan: Ang di-pantay na pagkakabahagi ng kita at mga disparidad sa ekonomiya ay isang mahalagang isyu sa maraming lipunan. Ang mga taong may mababang kita at mga marginalized na komunidad ay madalas na humaharap sa mas malalaking mga hamong pinansyal, na gumagawa ng pag-ahon mula sa kahirapan na mahirap gawin. Ang pagtugon sa mga sistemikong suliranin ay mahalaga sa pagbawas ng mga problema sa pinansyal sa mas malawakang antas ng lipunan.\n\nTindog 3: Ang mga problema sa pinansyal ay resulta ng mga personal at panlabas na mga salik, at kailangan ng isang malalimang paraan upang malutas ang mga ito nang epektibo. Ang perspektibang ito ay nagmumungkahi na ang mga problema sa pinansyal ay maaaring magmula sa iba't ibang pinagmulan, kasama ang mga personal na mga desisyon, di-inaasahang kalagayan, o mas malawak na mga takbo ng ekonomiya. Angkop itong nagmungkahi ng isang maramurang paraan na nagpapagsama-sama ng personal na responsibilidad, sistemikong pagbabago, at suportadong patakaran upang malutas nang malawakan ang mga suliranin sa pinansya.\nKatibayan/Dahilan: Ang mga problema sa pinansyal ay komplikado at maaaring maimpluwensyahan ng iba't ibang mga salik, kasama na ang personal na kalagayan, mga pansamantalang pangyayari, at pang-istrakturang mga salik. Ang pagkilala sa malalimang kalikasan ng mga problema sa pinansyal ay nagbibigay-daan sa mas malawakang mga solusyon na pakikitunguhan ang mga root na sanhi at nagbibigay ng suporta sa mga indibidwal at komunidad na nahaharap sa mga hamong pinansyal.\n\nAng mga perspektibang ito ay maaaring magsilbing isang punto ng pag-uunawa at pag-uusap sa mga problema sa pinansyal, ngunit mahalagang tandaan na ang mga karanasan at kalagayan ng bawat indibidwal ay maaaring mag-iba ng malaki.\n\n𝗗𝗘𝗩𝗘𝗟𝗢𝗣𝗘𝗥 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗞: https://www.facebook.com/marjhuncutiee\n\n✿━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━✿\n🌸|• ᴄᴏᴍᴍᴀɴᴅ [ ᴀɪ ] ᴇxᴇᴄᴜᴛᴇᴅ ᴛɪᴍᴇ :\n2024-01-10 09:37:41 AM",

Gipaduyog niini ang importansya sa edukasyon ug personal nga responsibilidad sa pagtubag sa mga isyu sa pinansyal.\n\nKadugangang Ebisensya/Rason: Gipakita sa mga paningkamot nga daghan kaayo ang naglisod sa basic nga kaalam sa pinansyal, nga mahimo nagdala sa dili maayong mga desisyon sa pinansyal ug sukmahan sa tumong nga mga kahimtang. Sa pagsugod sa pagpalambo sa edukasyon sa pinansyal ug pagpalambo sa maayong mga kinaiya sa pinansyal, mas maayo nga madumala sa mga tawo ug mga panimalay ang ilang pinansyal ug mas mubaba ang kahimtang sa pagkasudlon sa mga problema sa pinansyal.\n\npagsabot 2: Ang mga problema sa pinansyal gikan sa panguna nga mga sistematiko, nga resulta sa mga pagkamahayag sa ekonomiya ug mga isyu sa estruktural nga naghadlok sa kakayahan sa mga tawo nga makaagom og kahingusgan sa panalapi ug kasegurohan sa pinansyal.

== SCREENSHOT COMMAND DOCUMENTATION ==

MYBOT now includes two different screenshot commands to capture webpages:

1. Basic Screenshot Command:
   - Command: ss
   - Usage: {PREFIX}ss <url>
   - Example: {PREFIX}ss google.com
   - Description: Takes a quick screenshot of a webpage

2. Advanced Screenshot Command:
   - Command: screenshot (aliases: web, capture)
   - Usage: {PREFIX}screenshot <url> [options]
   - Options:
     • full - Captures the entire webpage (full-page screenshot)
     • mobile - Captures the page in mobile view
   - Examples:
     • {PREFIX}screenshot google.com
     • {PREFIX}screenshot facebook.com full
     • {PREFIX}screenshot twitter.com mobile

The advanced command uses Puppeteer for better quality screenshots with more options, but if it fails, it will automatically fall back to the API service used by the simple command.

Features of the Advanced Command:
- Better webpage rendering
- Full-page screenshots
- Mobile view screenshots
- More reliable for complex websites

Note: Screenshots may take 5-10 seconds to process, especially for complex websites.
